We are a collective for the study of media use. The word “media” is very broadly implied and we study how and why people behave as they do, especially as they engage with media. Within this canvas, we study the connections between globalization and internet users, those between algorithms and behaviors on social media usage. This has us venturing into how user behaviors impact other users - for example how important are user reviews for other consumers, or how and why people consume news and get exposed to misinformation. If we were to pin ourselves to a discipline, “media and communication” would be close.

Methodologically, our group is very diverse and we encourages methods (including mixed-methods) that are best suited for the questions at hand. We conduct interviews, analyze passively collected behavioral data, social media data, conduct online and offline experiments and surveys, as well as applied computational methods (machine learning, network analysis, text mining, etc).
