Misinformation easily spreads on social media and fact-checkers have an important role in correcting falsehoods. Most misinformation is of a partisan nature and appeals selectively to users on the basis of ideology. Thus, it is possible that fact checks may not overcome existing ideological divisions on social media. Through multiple studies investigating fact checking in USA and India, the two largest democracies, we investigate why fact checkers are unable to live up to their promise.
