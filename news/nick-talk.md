"Complexity in the Digital News Media Ecosystem"

# Abstract
Structures drive the macro-level characteristics we observe in digital news media. Complex interactions among news production, distribution, and consumption create emergent structural pressures, shaping the system as a whole in unpredictable ways. In this work, I aim to highlight consequential emergent characteristics in familiar news processes. I argue that blending communication theory with complexity science provides a powerful analytic lens, revealing novel explanations for long-observed behaviors in journalists, platforms, and audiences. Using a case study of news dissemination on TikTok, I further explore the implications of this complexity framework for designing real-world platform interventions.
