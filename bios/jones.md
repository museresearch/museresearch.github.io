Dominic is a computational social scientist with interests in, broadly, social epistemology: how is it that groups of people form their beliefs about what is “true”? He focuses on systems and media we use to communicate and coordinate action, particularly on group coordination, conflict, and information flows between platforms. Dominic is a graduate student in Computer Science and has worked professionally as a public policy economist.
