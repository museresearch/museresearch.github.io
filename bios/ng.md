Yee Man Margaret Ng (Ph.D., University of Texas) is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Journalism and Department of Computer Science (faculty affiliate) at The University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign. She is a media researcher with certified industrial training in data science and computational methods.

Her research blends grounded-theory approaches with computational methods and real-world data. Specifically, she explores three distinctive-yet-interrelated components– user behavior, embedded structures, and content framing – of the Web as a form of media and technology, as well as its role in social dysfunction.

She encourages any highly motivated graduate and undergraduate students to chat with her and the research group for potential research opportunities.
